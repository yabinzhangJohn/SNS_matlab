
% The Matlab Code (Version 1) is created by ZHANG Yabin,
% Nanyang Technological University, 2015-12-30
% which is based on the method described in the following paper 
% [1] Wang, Yu-Shuen, et al. "Optimized scale-and-stretch for image resizing." 
% ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG) 27.5 (2008): 118. 
% The binary code is provided on the project page:
% http://graphics.csie.ncku.edu.tw/Image_Resizing/
% The Matlab codes are for non-comercial use only.
% Note that the importance maps are slightly different from the original
% ones, and the retargeted images are influenced.


The code has been tested on the Windows system.
